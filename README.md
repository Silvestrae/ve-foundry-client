## Discord Rich Presence

In order to enable and use Rich Presence, you also need to have the module [Foundry VTT Rich Presence](https://github.com/JeidoUran/fvtt-rich-presence) installed and enabled on each world you want to use it with. Furthermore, you need to enable the option **Enable Discord Rich Presence** in both the **Client Configuration** and the **Module Settings**, as it is off by default.

## Customization

The **Theme Editor** lets you tweak every aspect of the client’s look and feel:

1. **Base Theme**  
   Choose either **Codex** or **Original** as your starting point.

2. **Fine-tune colors & effects**  
   Adjust background(s), text, accent and button colors, as well as particle effects (count, speed & opacity).

3. **Custom assets**
   - **Background images**: upload your own.
   - **Fonts**: import from Google Fonts URLs or load a local font file.

## Sharing & Portability

Open the **Share** menu to **export** or **import** your configuration:

- **Export**

  - Full settings (app + theme)
  - Theme only

- **Import**
  - From a JSON file
  - From clipboard

You can save the JSON to disk or copy it to your clipboard.  
Perfect for GMs who want to distribute a custom setup or theme to their players.

> **Privacy note:** Exported files never include sensitive fields like auto-login usernames, passwords, admin passwords, or local font-file paths.
